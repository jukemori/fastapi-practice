## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing these modules, you'll understand:

- **Backend Development**: APIs, databases, authentication, testing
- **Infrastructure**: Containers, cloud services, deployment strategies
- **System Design**: How components work together, scaling, performance
- **Security**: Best practices for protecting applications and data
- **DevOps**: Development workflows, CI/CD, monitoring

## 🛠️ Practical Application

All concepts are demonstrated through a real todo application using:
- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI with Python
- Databases: PostgreSQL + Neo4j
- Containers: Docker/Podman
- Cloud: AWS deployment
- Documentation: Sphinx

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Sequential Learning**: Follow the numbered order for best understanding
2. **Reference Material**: Use as a handbook for specific topics
3. **Hands-On Practice**: Run the examples and modify them
4. **Build Projects**: Apply concepts to your own applications

## 🎓 Skill Levels

- **Beginner**: Modules 00-04 (Foundation concepts)
- **Intermediate**: Modules 05-11 (Technology implementation)
- **Advanced**: Modules 12-14 (Architecture and integration)

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge
- Command line familiarity
- Web browser understanding
- No prior backend experience needed!

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Read the [Overview](00-overview.md) to understand your learning path
2. Set up the todo application (see main README.md)
3. Start with [Backend Basics](01-backend-basics.md)
